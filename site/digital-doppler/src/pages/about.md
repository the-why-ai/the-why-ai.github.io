# About Me

I am a research-driven AI/ML engineer with over five years of experience delivering end-to-end machine learning solutions that drive significant business value. My work centers on productionizing and maintaining sophisticated, deep-learning-as-a-service models on the Google Cloud Platform, transforming terabytes of complex data into actionable intelligence.

### Professional Philosophy

I believe in building robust, scalable, and modular systems. My approach is rooted in a deep understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings of modern machine learning and the practical realities of deploying these systems in a business environment. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge techniques from the latest research to solve real-world problems, whether that means optimizing model performance, reducing operational costs, or unlocking entirely new capabilities for the business.

### Highlights of My Experience

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of challenging and impactful projects:

*   **Generative AI and NLP:** I have extensive experience leveraging Generative AI for tasks like summarization and structured data extraction from customer service calls, enabling businesses to rapidly identify and address trending issues. I have also used NLP embedding techniques to discover emerging topics and trends in large volumes of text data.
*   **Large-Scale Machine Learning:** I have architected and implemented systems for training models on massive datasets, including training over 1.3 million models in parallel and working with datasets containing 100 billion rows and 1 million features.
*   **Cloud Architecture and MLOps:** As a technical lead, I have managed and mentored teams in architecting and deploying production-grade ML solutions on GCP. I have a deep understanding of best practices in MLOps, including experiment tracking, CI/CD, and building self-service deployment platforms.
*   **Business Impact:** I am proud of my track record of delivering tangible results, such as increasing survey accuracy by 140%, reducing model training times by 60%, and enabling a new program that provides early assistance to thousands of at-risk members each month.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills to solve complex problems. If you are looking for a partner to help you unlock the value of your data, I would love to hear from you.
